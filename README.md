GTINVerification
================

  The project implements a verification class for GTIN-8,GTIN-12,GTIN-13 and GTIN-14 codes according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number.
It does not check whether the GTIN is really registered but only checks the checksum of the GTIN and correctness of format. In a next version a check versus a database will be implemented.
